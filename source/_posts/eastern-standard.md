Very good cocktails. Elena order a martini (and she does not like martinis) and she liked it. I ordered a Sazerac and it was also very good (they made it half brandy, half rye). Our appetizers, the lobster-stuffed squash blossoms and the salt cod fitters were both very good- the fry on them was very well done and not overly oily. Our entrees were nothing special but still good. I got the Grilled Bavette Steak Frites. The steak was good but not amazing and the fries were crispy and pillowy. Elena got the Pulled Short Ribs which was good but again, nothing special. The homemade chips were interesting. Not super crispy like a kettle chip but had the texture of a baked chip, Elena like them. Overall 2/4 Beans. We will probably go back just for drinks and appetizers and to try the amazing looking chocolate cake that we were too full to get.

Note to anyone who might go in Boston- don’t try to go when the Red Sox are playing. You won’t be able to find parking.
