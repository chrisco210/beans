This was good.  All of the pasta at Rezdora is freshly made, so we had to try the 5 course pasta tasting menu, which is literally just 5 pasta dishes, so don't expect anything else.  Not that that is a bad thing, as all of the pasta is truly unique.  

First, we had some weird potato puff thing, which was more interesting to imagine how they got the potato in than it was tasty.

After the potato thing, we had the first course of the tasting, tortellini in brodo.  The tortellini were tiny, about the size of a dime.  Someone must have really tiny fingers.  The filling was mortadella - a common theme on the menu - which has a pungent porky taste.

Next we had a Tortellini in Brodo.  The tortellini were intricately wrapped, the size of dimes.  Maybe we are uncultured, but the tortellini were very firm, which was unexpected.  The broth itself was a chicken broth which was so chickeny it was like drinking liquified mcnugget.  The filling was a mortadella, which was pungent in a good way.

Next was Elena's favorite, Strichetti Verde com Pomodoro.  It was a spinach bow-tie pasta with a tomato sauce and parmesan cream.  The pasta had an excellent texture, but the real star was the tomato sauce.  The sauce tasted like tomato, with a healthy amount of olive oil.  Normally, the olive oil we have at home is bitter, but this olive oil almost tasted sweet.
