This was good.  All of the pasta at Rezdora is freshly made, so we had to try the 5 course pasta tasting menu, which is literally just 5 pasta dishes, so don't expect anything else.  Not that that is a bad thing, as all of the pasta is truly unique.  

First, we had some weird potato puff thing, which was more interesting to imagine how they got the potato in than it was tasty.

After the potato thing, we had the first course of the tasting, tortellini in brodo.  The tortellini were tiny, about the size of a dime.  Someone must have really tiny fingers.  The filling was mortadella - a common theme on the menu - which has a pungent porky taste.

The tortellini were intricately wrapped, the size of dimes.  Maybe we are uncultured, but the tortellini were very firm, which was unexpected.  The broth itself was a chicken broth which was so chickeny it was like drinking liquified mcnugget.  The filling was a mortadella, which was pungent in a good way.

Next was Elena's favorite, Strichetti Verde com Pomodoro.  It was a spinach bow-tie pasta with a tomato sauce and parmesan cream.  The pasta had an excellent texture, but the real star was the tomato sauce.  The sauce tasted like tomato, with a healthy amount of olive oil.  Normally, the olive oil we have at home is bitter, but this olive oil almost tasted sweet.  Overall, unlike any pasta I have ever had before.

*Ok... This is kind of bad but I am writing this review in July of 2022, we visited in December of 2021.  I just needed some time to think, definitely was not just lazy. I did not take a picture of the tasting menu, so I do not remember what the rest of the dishes were called, so we'll just have to go with what they were for the rest of the review.*

The next course was a penne-shaped pasta with a morel mushroom cream sauce. This was also a highlight.  The sauce was perfectly creamy, which was complimented by the chewyness of the pasta.

The mushroom flavor was unparalelled for any other mushroom dish I have ever had.  The sheer intensity of mushroom flavor is truly what sets this dish apart.

The next course was a thin pasta with a lighter tomato-pork-sausage sauce.  This had an intense flavor, similar to the filling of the first courses tortellini.

This was not as interesting as the other dishes, as the pasta shape was not super complex, and the flavor was not as unique as other dishes.  However, this still had an exceptional taste and a ton of flavor.  

Finally, for one of the highlights of the meal, we had agnulotti with a mortadella filling, parmesan cream sauce, drizzled tableside with a 25 year old balsamic vinegar.

The flavor of the parmesan, intensity of the mortadella, combined with the rich sweetness and acidity of the vinegar made this one of the most exciting dishes we tasted.  The agnulotti was intrecitely pressed, with the perfect amount of filling between springy sheets of pasta.  The parmesan cream sauce coated the pasta so that every bite had an even layer of paremsan. All of this would have been great on its own, but the real trick was the balsamic vinegar.  This elevated the dish with the acidity and sweetness to something neither of us had experienced before.

As for dessert, we got an apple cake and a tiramisu, both of which were excellent.

As for final takeaways, this certainly was an experience.  As of now, it is certainly the best restaurant we have reviewed thus far.  However, we have some thoughts.  Although the tasting menu was fun, you may be better off ordering individual items that you want.  Portions for these are similarly small, so you may need to order multiple, but this may give you a wider selection at a better value. 

Overall, Rezdora has earned its 4/4 beans.  

Oh we also got the cheese platter, which was good.
