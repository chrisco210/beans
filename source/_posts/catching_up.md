I know, we have not posted in a year.  However, we have still been eating out, and have been planning to make a comeback for a while, yet a lack of interest and some laziness have led me to to fail to write these.  

We need a reset - so I have a rapid fire review of a few places we have been.  I don't remember all the details of everything we ate, but I do remember the ratings we gave, so these count as a "real" review.

## Purple Pig
Excellent Chicago restaurant right off Michigan Ave.  Pictured is an excellent beet dish which were the best beets I have had.

## Korus
Michelin-recommended restaurant in Paris that definitely needs to be given some stars.  We had a 7 course tasting here and everything was fantastic.  Wine pairings as well were excellent.

## Boutary
Second Paris on this list.  This was another tasting, which again was very good.  Some of the flavors did not quite work in our eyes, however, falling short of the four beans.

## 1928 Beacon Hill
On a quaint street in beacon hill this restaurant serves heavy-hitting classic braises and steaks.  Everything was very well done, but the cocktails were a bit off.  A bit on the expensive side, for what you get however.

## Comfort Kitchen
Named one of the best new restaurants in Massachussets, and being a few minutes from my apartment, we had been trying to eat here for a while.  Having no more than 20 seats, this proved difficult. We were finally able to get a reservation just recently.  Serving unique, spice-laden food, some items were standouts while others were not.  Overall they well deserve the reputation.

## Uni
Outstanding, have not had Japanese food like this since the inspiration of this  blog, Iron Chef Morimotos in Hawaii.  Simply the best piece of tuna I have ever eaten, and that was only the "medium fatty" variety.  Delicious dumplings, and Armenian-style bread that reminded me a bit of Texas Roadhouse.  Unfortunately the fried chicken bao bun, though pretty good, needed some work.
