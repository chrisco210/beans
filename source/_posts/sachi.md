On recommendation of Yibo, on the first day in New York we tried Sachi Asian Bistro. It rained on the way there, so we started off with a hot miso soup.  We probably could have done without it.  It was a little boring, like a watered down powdered miso soup.

Next, we had the grilled glazed octopus.  This was definitely the best thing we had.  It had a nice grill char, and a slightly sweet glaze.  The octopus had a firm, but not chewy texture.  Elena, who hates (unfried) octopus, loved it.

Next, we got a Peking duck spring roll.  This was not very ducky, and was kind of boring.  The sauce really emphasized the boring.

We got some dim sum, which included shrimp dumplings, mushroom dumplings, and pork buns.  These were all good, except for the mushroom, which was a little weird.  Elena liked it all.

Finally, we got entrees.  I got a tonkatsu ramen with pork belly, which was pretty good, but not amazing.  The soup had a strange sweetness to it that kind of made your teeth hurt after eating it for a while, which was annoying.  However, the pork belly was very flavorful, and made the soup worth it.

Elena had the spicy singapore laksa noodle soup, which Elena thought was phenomenal.  The soup was creamy, a good level of spice with it being not so hot that you cannot taste it, and a ton of flavor.  The elements of the soup were good, but Elena did not really like the fish cakes.  I liked it too.

Overall, I gave it a 2.5/4, just for the spring roll, while Elena gave it a 3/4, so overall, Sachi gets 2.75/4 beans.  Also its a great deal for the amount of food you can get.  A solid choice.
