Milkstand is a new brunch place at the old location of the Byrne Dairy.  They feature breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but we were there for the breakfast.  The most notable thing about the restaurant is the aesthetic.  It is almost as if you are eating in some kind of music video, with pastel pink combined with metallic gold everything, down to the silverware.  

I channeled Vincent Vega and got a 7 dollar vanilla milkshake, but unfortunately, it was only ["sort of fucking good"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZzai6at_xA).  The coffee was only ok.

Next, I got a classic - grits with sausage gravy and eggs.  The eggs were underseasoned, and not crispy.  I guess that is technically what a sunny side up egg is supposed to be, but crispy eggs would have been better with grits.  Overall, it was not bad.  

Elena got the milkstand omelet, which had cheddar, gruyere, and mozzarella.  The best part of the omelet was the hashbrowns that came with it, which were very good.  Just a standard cheese omelet - you get what you ask for.   

Now, lets talk fries.  If you are on a diet, these are great.  Containing almost no actual potato, they make you sad when you bite into them.  Why you would make fries so thin and deflated is beyond me - fries did not need fixing.  Elena, however, thinks these are the best fries she has ever had.  Her roommate also said they were good (probably peer pressure).  

Overall, my rating is a 1/4 beans.  Elena gave it a 2/4 because the fries were "so good".  This leaves milkstand with a 1.5/4 beans.  Solid, but certainly not the best breakfast in Ithaca.
