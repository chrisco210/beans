Ten Foot Henry, Calgary. Solid restaurant in Calgary. I had some time before a flight so I got lunch / dinner here, so unfortunately no Elena this time. To start, I got a nice beet salad with pickled zucchini and some kind of green babaganoush type sauce.

There was a nice spice blend sprinkled on top, which went well with some crunchy nuts throughout. Combining all these gave a nice bite. Overall tasty, though it doesn’t come close to the beet salad at Purple Pig Chicago. Next I had Arctic Char in a green curry sauce, with some veggies you would see in a green curry.

The sauce was excellent, and went well with the fish. Maybe the fish could have been a bit less dry, but I’m not saying anything definitive. Finally I have a butterscotch pudding for dessert, which was excellent.

Nice spot if you ever find yourself in Calgary, 3/4 beans.
