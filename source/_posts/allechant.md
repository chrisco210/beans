Elena and I shared a French onion soup as an appetizer. Unfortunately, there was hardly any cheese on the top, and far too few onions. 
For entrees, Elena got the gnocchi with Gorgonzola sauce, while I got a chicken with mashed potatoes. Elenaâ€™s gnocchi was excellent, while my chicken was a little underwhelming. For 25 dollars, you would expect more than just chicken thighs.

The desserts, however, were excellent. The cake was layers of sponge with merengue on both sides, with a plum filling in the middle, which was exceptional. The panna cotta was less exceptional. The actual yoghurt was good, but the raspberries were far too acidic.

Overall, Chris: 2/4, Elena: 3/4, so in total, 2.5 / 4.
