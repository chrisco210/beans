Fallow - this place was well reviewed but I am not sure I can agree. We decided to only have entrees since we had eaten lunch two hours before. I ordered the ex-dairy cow strip steak and Elena ordered a hen of the woods mushroom burger. The steak did not have a great flavor, and I thought it could have been more seasoned. It was still decent though, and sustainable I guess. The mushroom burger was again, interesting but not exceptional. It had a bit of a soggy breading, and a fried flavor that I didnâ€™t care for. However, the two deserts, ice cream and some kind of crumble were excellent. 2.5/4 beans.
