## Simeons

Simeons plus bonus Mont Tremblant review. Overall, Simeons was good, but overpriced, the garlic bread had a bitter garlic flavor, which made it not very good garlic bread. The lobster Mac was generous on the lobster, and has an overall good flavor.

The bolognese, however, was good, but absurdly overpriced. 28 dollars for bolognese is absurd. The price has to be mentioned even though that shouldn’t have to be the focus of the review.

Overall, 2/4 for food, -.5 for extortion, so 1.5/4 overall. Don’t go here, there are better restaurants less than 3 feet away.

## Bonus Review: La Forge Mont Tremblant. 
![Filet with Fois Gras](/images/simeons1/laforge1.jpeg)
I had the filet with a piece of fois gras on top and a sauce. My meal was very good, with the meat very well seasoned. The fois gras texturally went very well with the filet, which I was not expecting. However, Alex had an absolutely bad bernaise sauce, which leaves no room for an unprecedented 4/4, so overall, La Forge receives a 3/4.
