We waited outside for exactly one house before being seated but Neptune Oyster is well worth the wait. We started out by selecting 8 oysters and they all were good but the highlight was Neptune’s in-house oyster, the Neptune Pearl (when we go again we will just be getting those as they were maybe the best oysters we’ve ever had). Then we got the whole sardine salad. Elena didn’t love it but I thought they were very good. The sardines almost had a curry flavor to them which was very unique and delicious. Then we got our entrees. Elena had a Fritto Misto sandwich. You wouldn’t think fried lobster would have a good flavor or be as flavorful as a regular lobster roll but it was very good and the lobster was so juicy. I had the Bass which was also very good. The fish was flakey and the north was so flavorful. All in all everything was delicious but if we were going to go again, we would get less food (the portions are very large). We will definitely be going back for the Neptune Pearl Oysters. Fantastic! 3.25/4 beans
