Finally got a reservation at gola. We had a mushroom soup appetizer, which we started eating before taking the picture. The soup was mushroomy, with an earthy finish, like eating dirt, but in a good way.

The lasagna tasted fresh and light, with the perfect ratio of tomato sauce. Elena’s black spaghetti was interesting… fermented chilis and black spaghetti taste good together, but the chili’s were not incorporated as a sauce, just put on top. Also, Italian sausage and picked chili do not work.

Overall, it was a fusion confusion. dessert was good.
