Mix Social Dining. Dinner started off strong, with the best dish of the night, fried chicken and waffles with a sriracha sauce. The mussels were good, if a little bland for a Thai sauce.

Then disaster struck. 1/4 of the menu was taken up by a butcher block, with five cuts of steak. We decided to go for the filet with a Demi glacé made of port. Unfortunately when the steak arrived, it resembled more of a reduced-for-quick-sale ground beef than a prime filet. Unsurprisingly, it was bland. The asparagus tasted like boiled lettuce.

Luckily, the cheesy potatoes were good. Elena enjoyed the ungodly tomato topped with breadcrumbs. I did not. The Cajun fries were good, but how do you screw that up. Dessert was unremarkable.

Overall, stick to the tapas, stay far away from the beef. 3/5 beans.
