Reviving the blog with my new domain (with my new future Spouse) rachlinyan.com.  
Switched from self hosting to Github pages + automations, should mean I can 
actually update the blog more frequently now.  Luckily, I have the perfect oppertuntiy to
do so.  

First, we had the amouse bouche.  The star of this was the arctic char in soy,
which had a soy sauce that reminded us of Morimoto's in Maui. On the left was a tuna 
tartare, and on the right was a fritter.

The first course - and arguably one of the stars of the whole meal - was a thin
layer of tuna pounded into a sheet, on top of sliced baguette with fois gras.

Hard to describe this - the tuna and fois gras melt in your mouth, while the 
bread gave it some structure.  You got a great crunch followed by a melt-in-your-mouth 
sensation, with a lemony fresh oil sauce giving a burst of flavor.  The wine pairing
was also a standout - a Gruner Vetliner produced through a partnership from the Sommelier
of the restaurant and the vineyard of Gerhard Kracher.  Fresh and crisp but also
with a depth of minerality - really great.

A spicy, curry-like lobster dish.  Compared to the subtle flavor of the previous
dish, the dish woke me up.  Tender lobster, combined with a spicy broth always works
well.
